Regarding the 6 passenger wording, I've also changed it in the Release of Cremains section to say "Up to 5 guests" instead of "Up to 6 people" for better clarity. Of course, let me know if this is wrong, but I'm assuming that the 6 total passenger including Doug applies here too.
Replaced logo with one without the background, just to see how it'd look. (I know you guys have a new logo coming, this is more of a test to see what a logo with a transparent background will look like.)
