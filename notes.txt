Should I also delete the picture of Doug on the "About Us" page? If so, what should I put there instead?
Regarding "Change to maximum 5 for all instead of maximum 4-5."
I'll Re-add the pictures that have the kids but I'd double check on the legality of doing so, I'm not a lawyer but that seems like something that would be iffy, legally
A more square or wide picture would be nice for the desktop version of the site in the Whale watching section
I'll add a version of the gallery collage to the About Us section (under the boat area)
