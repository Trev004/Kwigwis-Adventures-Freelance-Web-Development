Welcome to Kwigwis Adventures.

About your Guide

My name is Douglas Smith and I was born and raised here in Campbell River. My family lineage is  is deeply rooted in the coast, with connections to Campbell River, Smiths Inlet, Blunden Harbour, and Takush Harbour.


Fishing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember — I started my commercial fishing journey at the age of 8, working alongside my father on seine boats and gillnetters. From the late 70's onward, l've traveled the coast from San Juan to Dundas Island countless times, and spent many seasons fishing t. V vest coast in Barkley Sound.


For me, fishing has never been "just a job" — it's a way of life. It's something I deeply respect and

will always love. Through Kwigwis Adventures, l'm proud to share my knowledge, experience, and connection to these waters with you.

Kwigwis in Kwak'wala means Eagle of the Sea — a symbol of strength, vision, and connection to the ocean. I look forward to welcoming you

aboard and showing you the beauty of our coast.
