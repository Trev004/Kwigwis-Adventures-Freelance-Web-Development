# Kwigwis Adventures Freelance Web Development
Freelance web development project for the Smiths. A fishing charter website.

## TODO:
- Add other pages (about us, gallery (*maybe* a dedicated contact page too?))
    - About Us/Boat will have info about the craft
    - Gallery will have photos (carousel?) of previous fishing trips
        - Maybe just have a list of photos instead? Keeping it simple. Maybe see about moving these photos to About Us, OR do what I said above and make a separate Contact Us page, and the buttons in the hero could be links to there as well?
- Style the site
    - blues, and dark blues
    - sans-serif fonts
    - use provided logo
    - enjoyed the look of [Island Life Fishing Charters](https://islandlifefishingcharters.com/)
        - simple, only a few pages
        - Hero/banner image
    - use [Bootstrap Icons(?)](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for fonts
        - Oswald (Header/Important Text)
        - Roboto (General?)
        - Montserrat (Fancy Text?)
        - [Selection used](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900|Oswald:wght@200..700|Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900)
    - Ensure it works correctly on mobile (gets kinda funky when phone is horizontal)
- Update Footer to include links to socials (or temp links for now)
- Use copy text provided (I believe there was some for the About us page, so work off of that for temp home page text)
- change span in packages list to an h3 or h4 tag for accessibility and SEO reasons
- Update the meta tags in the head for SEO reasons they're currently default
### Feedback 1
- Add a link to where to get their fishing license
    - https://recfish-pechesportive.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/nrls-sndpp/index-eng.cfm
- Update under about us, after the intro and Eagle of the Sea to [The text Here](TEMP-copytext.txt)
- Use the 2nd layout for the rates. 
    - Make a separate Rates/contact page and put them there
- Home page take out the business card temp logo and just use the regular Kwigwis Logo and Name
- Agree that buttons to contact us (Email and Link to Contact page perhaps?)
- Delete some temp text on the packages page 
    - Part about the charters incluing refreshments and tips etc.
- Try get a Carousel to work for the images instead of the list

### Feedback 2
- On the first page, say now booking for 2026, instead of bookings available
- Delete on the section about your guide, the repetitive Kwigwis meaning part.
- Keep Up and down Photos page instead of Carousel
- Delete Picture 4
- "Fuel Surchare" type on offerings page
- I think we should call that page Our Packages and Contact Information
- Quick charter and long change to Half-Day Charters and Full-Day Charters. Change to maximum 5 for all instead of maximum 4-5. Same with the whale watching section.
- We are getting a few whale watching pictures from our friends but we like what you added for wording. 
    - Meaning Keep wording I think
- Under the release of cremains at sea, change to we would travel out 15 minutes from the marina, come to a rest
- Under the fuel surcharge section under the release of the cremains, add on the end beyond the 15 minutes.
- Note: Get started on these and then some more wording sections and images will come mid-week sometime.
