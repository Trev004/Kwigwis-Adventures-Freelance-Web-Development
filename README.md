# Kwigwis Adventures Freelance Web Development
Freelance web development project for the Smiths. A fishing charter website.

## TODO:
- Add other pages (about us, gallery (*maybe* a dedicated contact page too?))
    - About Us/Boat will have info about the craft
    - Gallery will have photos (carousel?) of previous fishing trips
        - Maybe just have a list of photos instead? Keeping it simple. Maybe see about moving these photos to About Us, OR do what I said above and make a separate Contact Us page, and the buttons in the hero could be links to there as well?
- Style the site
    - blues, and dark blues
    - sans-serif fonts
    - use provided logo
    - enjoyed the look of [Island Life Fishing Charters](https://islandlifefishingcharters.com/)
        - simple, only a few pages
        - Hero/banner image
    - use [Bootstrap Icons(?)](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for fonts
        - Oswald (Header/Important Text)
        - Roboto (General?)
        - Montserrat (Fancy Text?)
        - [Selection used](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900|Oswald:wght@200..700|Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900)
    - Ensure it works correctly on mobile (gets kinda funky when phone is horizontal)
- Update Footer to include links to socials (or temp links for now)
- Use copy text provided (I believe there was some for the About us page, so work off of that for temp home page text)
- change span in packages list to an h3 or h4 tag for accessibility and SEO reasons
- Update the meta tags in the head for SEO reasons they're currently default
### Feedback 1
- Add a link to where to get their fishing license
    - https://recfish-pechesportive.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/nrls-sndpp/index-eng.cfm
- Update under about us, after the intro and Eagle of the Sea to [The text Here](TEMP-copytext.txt)
- Use the 2nd layout for the rates. 
    - Make a separate Rates/contact page and put them there
- Home page take out the business card temp logo and just use the regular Kwigwis Logo and Name
- Agree that buttons to contact us (Email and Link to Contact page perhaps?)
- Delete some temp text on the packages page 
    - Part about the charters incluing refreshments and tips etc.
- Try get a Carousel to work for the images instead of the list

### Feedback 2
- ~~On the first page, say now booking for 2026, instead of bookings available~~
- ~~Delete on the section about your guide, the repetitive Kwigwis meaning part.~~
- ~~Keep Up and down Photos page instead of Carousel~~
- ~~Delete Picture 4~~
- ~~"Fuel Surchare" type on offerings page~~
- ~~I think we should call that page Our Packages and Contact Information~~
- ~~Quick charter and long change to Half-Day Charters and Full-Day Charters. Change to maximum 5 for all instead of maximum 4-5. Same with the whale watching section.~~
- ~~We are getting a few whale watching pictures from our friends but we like what you added for wording. ~~
    - ~~Meaning Keep wording I think~~
- ~~Under the release of cremains at sea, change to we would travel out 15 minutes from the marina, come to a rest~~
- ~~Under the fuel surcharge section under the release of the cremains, add on the end beyond the 15 minutes.~~
- ~~Under the release of cremains section:~~
    - ~~Delete there is no ceremony per se Kwigwis Adventures can accommodate you if you wish…(same wording).~~
    - ~~Replace with: Spiritual journeys at sea can be described as a gentle return to the elements, a passage from individuality into something larger, timeless, and deeply peaceful. Releasing cremated remains to the ocean is more than a farewell; it is a spiritual journey back to the source of life itself. The sea’s endless horizon invites families to see this moment not as an ending, but as a peaceful transition into a larger, timeless whole. ~~
- Note: Get started on these and then some more wording sections and images will come mid-week sometime.

### Feedback 2.5
- ~~Delete Pictures 4, 6 and 7 of Doug~~
- Add new Pictures
    - ~~Add one Whale to the Section on Whale watching, and the other on the gallery~~
    - ~~Whale watching Credit: Lyle & Deidre Morrow~~

### Feedback 3
- ~~Taking the duplicate picture out in both spots was perfect.~~
- ~~You can take the one picture with the youth and 2 adults out, the young gal is our daughter so that’s ok.~~
- ~~For the desktop version, could we do 3 pictures say the logo one, I don’t have one with the blue around it, a picture of the boat and nice fish picture? Say the logo in the middle and the other 2 on the other sides or even 4 and include a whale one? I got more whale ones.~~
- ~~Boat pictures are great there~~
- ~~We can get rid of the 6 passenger wording as Doug double checked and the max is 6 with him.~~

### Feedback 4
- ~~Just add the pictures for now~~
- ~~New social links~~
    - ~~Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Kwigwis-Adventures/61578956918261/~~
    - ~~TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kwigwisadventuresshaw.ca~~
- ~~Fish Hook Logo text looks good~~
- ~~Change the rates for the whale watching.~~
    - ~~4 hour $165.00 per person *~~
    - ~~8 hour $295.00 per person *~~
    - ~~*12 % fuel surcharge applies for all whale watching tours~~
    - ~~This is based on minimum 4 people per tour, prices may be subject to change if less than 4 people.~~
    - ~~Ask about half day whale watching and 2 hour fishing charters.~~ **NOTE: wording is a lil funky here, since the half day charter is listed right above it, what is there to ask about?**
- ~~Under Rates and Packages~~
    - ~~Add an S to Fishing Charter to say Fishing Charters~~
- ~~I think it would be nice to add a picture of the boat on the bottom of the front page. What do you think? (Yeah sure, nothing there anyway so more visual variety wouldn't hurt)~~
    - ~~I will send one, maybe it can be smaller.  And add a smaller whale picture beside the boat.~~ **NOTE: I believe there was an issue with sending these because I didn't get em**
- ~~Then delete the our charters section and add something smaller like:~~
    - ~~"Join us for an unforgettable adventure on the water."~~ **NOTE: I've rolled this text into the main intro text rather than have two sections and one only have a single sentence**
- ~~Change check out our offerings on the first page to "What we offer!"~~
- ~~Under the Gallery, delete the section the chat PGT section. ~~
    - ~~Add "A Look Back" in Photos.~~
        - ~~"Whether you're reminiscing or planning your own trip, let these memories inspire your next adventure!"~~
    - ~~Delete the previous charters section.~~
        - ~~(I believe this means replace "Previous Charters" section. with "A Look Back")~~

### Feedback 5
- ~~Can we change the wording on the front page to: If you are looking to book your sea adventure out of Campbell River, BC~~
    - **NOTE: the intro blurb? unsure of what was meant**
- The front page looks better with the pictures. 
- Can we add these recent photos to the gallery before the other pictures (as new and from a very recent trip).
    - Pictures provided
- The front looks good, I like the A Look Back, can we centre it and make it wider? Also add the below boat picture under the whale picture on the front, or could we make them align in 3 horizontally?
- Also, the ask about whale watching and 2 hour fishing charters, maybe add whatever suites you, we are flexible, call us to discuss further?
- Same with on the front page, centre the Welcome to Kwigwis Adventures and make it a bit larger.
- I haven’t created the instagram yet, so can we delete that until I get it created? Same with the YouTube.

## BEFORE LAUNCH CHECKLIST
- **NOTE: BEFORE LAUNCHING SITE FOR REAL, GO THROUGH ALL PHOTOS AND CHANGE ALT TEXT FOR SEO AND ACCESSABILITY REASONS. GALLERY, ABOUT US, CONTACT/OFFERINGS PAGE**
- Go through text to ensure there's no ChatGPT filler left behind. As of Jan 16th 2026 theres:
    - Emergency Response Transport
    - Footer
- Ensure consistency and eliminate redundancy by converting other h1 intros into the new intro-h1 class
- Fix Kwigwis Adventures Logo a lil, refine the photoshop of it.
- Improve the Contact Us section on contact page, the email and phone are pretty plain as is. Could use some extra styling for some information hierarchy and clarity.
- See about making the header sticky, especially important on the Gallery and Contact page on mobile since you're scrolling for quite a while.
