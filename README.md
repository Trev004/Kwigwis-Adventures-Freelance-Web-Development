# Kwigwis Adventures Freelance Web Development
Freelance web development project for the Smiths. A fishing charter website.

TODO:
- Add other pages (about us, gallery (*maybe* a dedicated contact page too?))
    - About Us/Boat will have info about the craft
    - Gallery will have photos (carousel?) of previous fishing trips
        - Maybe just have a list of photos instead? Keeping it simple. Maybe see about moving these photos to About Us, OR do what I said above and make a separate Contact Us page, and the buttons in the hero could be links to there as well?
- Style the site
    - blues, and dark blues
    - sans-serif fonts
    - use provided logo
    - enjoyed the look of [Island Life Fishing Charters](https://islandlifefishingcharters.com/)
        - simple, only a few pages
        - Hero/banner image
    - use [Bootstrap Icons(?)](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for fonts
        - Oswald (Header/Important Text)
        - Roboto (General?)
        - Montserrat (Fancy Text?)
        - [Selection used](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900|Oswald:wght@200..700|Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900)
    - Ensure it works correctly on mobile (gets kinda funky when phone is horizontal)
- Update Footer to include links to socials (or temp links for now)
- Use copy text provided (I believe there was some for the About us page, so work off of that for temp home page text)
- change span in packages list to an h3 or h4 tag for accessibility and SEO reasons
